# MAE 1200 Design Project: "Drone Gimbal"
GoPro Hero 4 Session

# The Design Requirements

Problem Statement:
Your task is to 
design a gimbal mechanism that can attach a GoPro Hero 4 Session to a 
3D printable version of the DJI Inspire drone

The gimbal mechanism should have at least 
- two (2) axis of rotation
- some form of dampening for image stabilization while the drone is in 
flight. 
- mechanically start and stop recording the gopro 
.

## Functional Requirements:

- The gimbal must have at least two (2) axis of rotation(roll and pitch) with a goal of having three (3) axis of rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw)

- The mass of the gimbal should not significantly affect flight times

- One end of the gimbal must be able to attach to the 3D Printable DJI Inspire 1 drone’s “Gimbal Frame”, as shown in figure 2, with a goal of this attachment being quick release in nature

- The other end of the gimbal must be able to attach to a GoPro Hero 4 Session with a goal of this attachment being quick release in nature

- The camera’s FOV must not be blocked by any part of the drone while facing forward in flight

- The gimbal must have the means be able to mechanically press the start/stop recording button on the GoPro Hero 4 Session

- The lowest portion of the camera/gimbal must be at least 15mm from the ground when the drone is on a flat surface

- The gimbal must use actuators that are common to remote control vehicles

- The other end of the gimbal must be able to attach to a GoPro Hero 4 Session, with a goal of this attachment being quick release in nature

- The camera’s FOV must not be blocked by any part of the drone while facing forward in fligh

- The gimbal must have the means be able to mechanically press the start/stop recording button on the GoPro Hero 4 Session

- The lowest portion of the camera/gimbal must be at least 15mm from the ground when the drone is on a flat surface
